# Webshare Stremio Addon

This addon enables streaming movies and series from Webshare.cz.

The main principles are simplicity and low-maintenance. For this reason there is no video catalog
which would provide high-quality content. This addon works by searching files directly on
webshare.cz. Note this may and does produce incorrect results, but you can usually quickly find the
correct streams.

Feel free to open up issues if you find any issues.

## How can I use it?

**This addon is not released yet.** Since the basic functionality works great I expect to release it
soon.

## Development

Follow the usual steps:

- install dependencies - `npm install`
- install the addon in local stremio instance - `npm start -- --install`

See [Stremion Addon SDK](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk) for more information.
